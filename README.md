# Machine Learning Algorithms (Jupyter Notebook)

This repository contains implementations of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms in Jupyter Notebooks.

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithms Implemented:

1. **Find-S Algorithm** - A simple approach to learning a hypothesis from positive examples.
2. **Candidate Elimination Algorithm** - Uses a version space approach to find a consistent hypothesis.
3. **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   - Classification  
   - Regression  
4. **Linear Regression** - Predicts continuous values based on a linear function.
5. **Decision Tree Algorithm** - A tree-based classification method.
6. **Perceptron Learning Algorithm** - Implemented for the AND Boolean Function.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it using:
```sh
pip install jupyter notebook
```
Run the Notebooks
Clone the repository and start Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-algorithms.git
cd machine-learning-algorithms
jupyter notebook
```
Open any .ipynb file to run the algorithm.
