To implement linear regression algorithm on a dataset of height & and width and
print regression coefficient and regression line.

Q. Given a set of points in a two-dimensional plane
As (x1, y1),
(x2, y2), (x3, y3)….. (x|D, y|D)

Use linear regression to find the equation of the best regression line for the above data points.

Print the regression coefficient w0 and w1. Apply linear regression algorithm using given
dataset and predict the weight of a person with height as 5’9”.

The dataset is
as follows:
x = [5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8]
y = [53, 55, 59, 61, 65, 68, 70, 74, 76]
